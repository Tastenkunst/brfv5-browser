# Beyond Reality Face SDK - v5.0.0b3 (BRFv5 - beta!) - Platform: Browser

### What is BRFv5?

It is a real-time face detection and face tracking SDK. It analyses image data (eg. a camera stream, video stream or a static image) and returns facial landmarks and data to place 3d objects on a face.

### Ready to try!

Read the EULA (eula.txt) carefully before using the SDK. You can try and test the trial SDK free of charge. Before you buy a license, please test the SDK thoroughly to find out whether it fits your project's needs. Once you decide to use BRFv5 commercially, please contact us via email. You will get a separate license agreement, that you must agree to.
